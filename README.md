Abstract

As more customers rely on online purchases, the importance of user ratings is growing. To identify which is the greatest product to buy, a consumer must read thousands of reviews of similar products prior to making a purchase, which can be time consuming. Customers' Amazon reviews are chaotic and unstructured, exposing underlying patterns that, when correctly mined with the right analysis tools, can revolutionize a company's products and service development.
Sentiment Analysis is one of the techniques that can be implemented to make sense of all the rating data. This project will focus on Sentiment Analysis on all unstructured content leveraging Amazon's online purchase rating metadata. The project work is based on the Software category of the metadata to automatically categorize and make sense of the customer ratings. This enables Amazon to gain a better understanding of customer behavior and demand for its products and services. 
The project task includes extensive text processing, exploratory analysis, time series analysis, and popularity-based recommender system. The Sentiment model utilizes the TF-IDF method and is built on classification machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN to compare performance metrics. Additionally, TextBlob is used to find the polarity measure of each rating. The model categorizes the customer ratings into positive, negative, and neutral which can be further analyzed to make recommendations.
Of the machine leaning sentiment analysis models, the Logistic Regression model gave the highest performance. Based on the findings of the project, narratives are created, and recommendations are made. This will help decision-makers and other stakeholders improve or change the business's direction as well as improve customer satisfaction with Amazon products and services.
